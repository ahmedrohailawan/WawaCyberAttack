            <div class="paragraph">In December 2019, Wawa convenience store chain announced a data breach that
              potentially exposed customers' personal and financial information. Malware was installed on the company's
              payment processing servers, collecting payment card information such as card numbers, names, and
              expiration dates. The breach affected all of Wawa's 850 locations, potentially compromising tens of
              millions of customer records. While the investigation did not reveal any evidence of fraud, customers were
              advised to monitor their financial accounts for suspicious activity. The Wawa cyber attack highlights the
              need for companies to prioritize cybersecurity measures to protect their customers' sensitive information.

            <div class="paragraph">The Wawa data breach in December 2019 was caused by malware that was installed on the
              company's payment processing servers. The malware was designed to collect payment card information,
              including card numbers, names, and expiration dates. The malware was able to capture this information as
              it was being processed by Wawa's servers, potentially compromising tens of millions of customer records.
              The specific type of malware used in the attack has not been publicly disclosed, but it is likely that it
              was a form of point-of-sale malware, which is commonly used in attacks on retailers and other businesses
              that process payment card transactions.</div>

            <div class="paragraph">Strong cybersecurity measures are essential in today's digital landscape due to the
              increasing number of cyber threats and attacks. These measures can protect against data breaches, cyber
              attacks, and help organizations comply with industry regulations related to the protection of personal and
              sensitive information. Strong cybersecurity can also help protect intellectual property from theft or
              misuse and safeguard critical infrastructure. Without robust cybersecurity measures, businesses and
              individuals can face significant financial, reputational, and legal consequences. Therefore, it is crucial
              to invest in strong cybersecurity measures to protect against the evolving cyber threats and keep
              sensitive data and assets secure.</div>

            <div class="paragraph">The Wawa cyber attack resulted in the compromise of personal and financial
              information of thousands of customers. The stolen information included payment card details, as well as
              names, addresses, and phone numbers. This highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to
              protect sensitive customer data from evolving cyber threats. The potential impact of data breaches can be
              significant, including financial loss, identity theft, damage to reputation, and legal consequences.
              Companies need to prioritize the protection of sensitive information and invest in cybersecurity measures
              to prevent cyber attacks and data breaches. The Wawa cyber attack serves as a reminder of the need for
              constant vigilance and proactive measures to protect against cyber threats.</div>
